  <description>[PAWN_nameDef] grew up behind reinforced glass, just beyond the war room where [PAWN_possessive] parent issued silent commands to a dying world. The halls were sterile, the uniforms always grey, and [PAWN_pronoun] quickly learned which doors never opened and which ones never closed. [PAWN_pronoun] was told the flickering silhouettes beyond the viewing screens were simulations, until one of them looked back. No one mentioned it afterward, and neither did [PAWN_pronoun].</description>

  <description>[PAWN_nameDef] designed Operation: Deadlife from the first blueprint to the last breath, believing death could be structured, harnessed, and weaponized. When the Death Door was first opened, [PAWN_pronoun] stepped through without hesitation, alone, unarmed, and smiling. [PAWN_pronoun] returned days later, silent and burned from within, wrapped in binding cloth and sealed inside a containment sarcophagus that no one claimed to understand. The war ended. The door remained open. [PAWN_pronoun] sleeps still - but the seals are growing warm.</description>
