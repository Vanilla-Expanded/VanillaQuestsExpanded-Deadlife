  <description>[PAWN_nameDef] volunteered for the first wave of transhuman necrosis trials, offering [PAWN_possessive] body to a military doctrine that worshipped permanence through decay. [PAWN_pronoun] endured months in a sealed vat as bone, tissue, and cognition were rewired by machine and fluid alike. What emerged was no longer fully alive, but unshakably loyal.</description>

  <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was stationed deep beneath the surface, tasked with protecting the bio-vaults that housed experimental regeneration tanks and failed prototypes. When containment alarms sounded, [PAWN_pronoun] didn’t flinch. The only thing [PAWN_pronoun] feared was failure-and fear had been surgically removed years ago.</description>

  <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was both soldier and scientist, one of the few entrusted to maintain the resurrection architecture embedded in elite corpses. [PAWN_pronoun] spliced code into spinal columns and rewrote death like it was faulty circuitry. Despite the grotesque procedures, [PAWN_pronoun] never hesitated-progress demanded flesh.</description>

Decades passed in blackout stasis, dreaming only of tactical formations and absolute obedience. When awakened, [PAWN_pronoun] resumed command as if the war had never paused.</description>

[PAWN_pronoun] still wears the scars of [PAWN_possessive] first death, though they’ve long ceased to matter. Now, [PAWN_pronoun] kills with the calm of someone who’s already passed judgment.</description>

  <description>[PAWN_nameDef] scrawled codes onto crates, noting date, contents, and threat tier. Many containers arrived unmarked, but [PAWN_pronoun] learned quickly: if it rattled, it was best to skip the contents line. Sometimes the ink bled upward, off the label, and into [PAWN_possessive] sleeve.</description>

  <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was in charge of verifying label integrity across the sealed vault grid. [PAWN_pronoun] spent entire shifts reading faded text under flickering lights, checking against catalogs no longer maintained. Some crates had no labels-just symbols that [PAWN_pronoun] could swear [PAWN_pronoun] remembered from dreams.</description>
