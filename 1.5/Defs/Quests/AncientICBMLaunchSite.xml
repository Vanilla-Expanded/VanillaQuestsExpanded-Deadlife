                <li>questDescription->We have intercepted a broadcast at a recently raided underground silo: Operation: Deadlife is now underway. Enough resource silos have been breached, and the plan has been set in motion. The broadcast confirms that [General_nameFull] has initiated final preparations at an ancient ICBM launch site.\n\nRefueling of the devastating missiles is in progress. These warheads are armed with deadlife dust payloads and if launched, they will detonate high in orbit, spreading a near-permanent death pall across the planet. It is likely that endless hordes of shamblers will then scour the world, consuming or destroying all remaining civilization.\n\nWe have traced the origin of the signal to the ICBM launch facility. We must travel there and stop [General_nameFull] before the launch sequence can be completed. The site is expected to be heavily defended, not only swarming with shamblers, but also protected by restored automated defenses.\n\n[General_nameFull] will activate numerous defensive systems from the facilityâ€™s control room: opening sealed death pits, releasing shambler animals from containment kennels, flooding the complex with rotstink gas, and awakening elite deadlife officers from cryogenic caskets.\n\nOnly by reaching and destroying the launch terminal can we prevent the missiles from firing. Failure to stop the launch in time, or ignoring this threat entirely, will doom the planet to a global shambler apocalypse.\n\nThis is our only chance to end Operation: Deadlife once and for all.</li>
