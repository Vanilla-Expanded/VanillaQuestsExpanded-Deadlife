        <letterText>Detonation of Deadlife dust warheads in the upper atmosphere has permanently altered planetary conditions. A dense death pall now blankets the world.\n\nThis pall reanimates all unburied corpses exposed to the open air. Any non-mechanoid corpse not under a roof will rise again as a shambler. Burned or fully destroyed corpses are unaffected.\n\nWhile the death pall is active, no normal weather transitions can occur. Rain will not fall, and fires may spread unchecked.\n\nOn a global scale, the death pall will linger for anywhere from three seasons to several years. In its wake, roaming Shambler hordes will now traverse the world, overrunning settlements and hunting down caravans.</letterText>
        <endMessage>Most of the deadlife dust has fallen. The death pall is ending.</endMessage>
