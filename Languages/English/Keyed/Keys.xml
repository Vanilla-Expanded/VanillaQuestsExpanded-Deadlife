	<VQED_GeneralAwakensText>The sealed sarcophagus hisses open, releasing a cloud of deadlife dust, and from within rises {PAWN_title} {PAWN_nameFull}.

Once the commander of Operation: Deadlife, {PAWN_nameFull} is now a shambler-bound remnant of a forgotten war. As {PAWN_pronoun} awakens, {PAWN_pronoun} begin reactivating the base’s long-dormant defense systems: rotstink vents, turret grids, shambler kennels, and containment pits filled with the dead.

{PAWN_possessive} ultimate goal is clear: to initiate the launch sequence for the Deadlife ICBMs: orbital warheads designed to blanket the planet in death. If launched, shambler hordes will rise across the world, destroying settlements and ambushing caravans.

You must reach the command center and destroy the ICBM Launch Terminal before {PAWN_nameFull} completes {PAWN_possessive} grim task.</VQED_GeneralAwakensText>
